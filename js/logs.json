    "1": "October 14, 4998\n\nWe've established contact with a group of androids on Phobos, claiming to have served humans during the golden age. I'd like to believe them, but I'm not aware of any operational androids. It’s not like we have much choice, though.\n\nOctober 15, 4998\n\nVik has been up to his usual tricks, sneaking out early this morning and wandering around the base. He believes we can reprogram the androids if we figure out how they have remained operational a thousand years after their construction.\n\nOctober 19, 4998\n\nWe've settled in here; the equipment is in perfect condition thanks to our chrome friends. They've made sure nothing deteriorates. I've taken a sample from one of them; it appears they're coated with billions of nanobots, which explains how they sustain themselves—they're like vast self-replicating colonies.\n\nMarch 30, 4999\n\nEzra has found an old tomb; he says it could contain important information. The rest of us have settled in and are making great strides in locating the code fragments. There must be 9 runes from a language we've named Pilgrim, likely opening some sort of door somewhere. If what Ezra says is true, it should lead us to the energy source of the Beacon.\nThe girl has been more spirited now that her father lets her join him on his expeditions; losing her mother must have been a hard blow. We all miss Eliza.\n\nApril 15, 4999\n\nThe forces of the Hostage are starting to multiply at an alarming rate, and we keep encountering raiders and scouts on the outskirts of the base area. I'm beginning to think they'll attack at any moment.\n\nApril 17, 4999\n\nMy fears have come true; a huge army is about to attack. The speed with which they've mobilized their forces is astonishing, and it seems that all our precautions may not be enough to stop their advance. We are all on alert.",
    "2": "Journal Entry: Tobin Vex - Ceres Incident, Date: Unknown\n\nLog Begin:\n\nAfter a long haul through the less-traveled sectors of the belt, we've touched down on Ceres, a rock I'd usually avoid but today serves as a crucial stop. Our little team, under Ezra's guidance, was to meet a contact for supplies and intel. Instead, we found pirates—just my luck.\n\nLena, ever the strategist, spotted the ambush moments before it unfolded. She's got an eye for trouble, which today, meant spotting a skulking skiff off our port bow. Her readiness kept us from being sitting ducks. If only my gadgets could preempt betrayal as effectively.\n\nKai, with his usual brave nonsense, was first to respond. The man moved like he was in one of those old Earth action flicks, bounding across the rocky terrain with a gusto I find both admirable and insane. His blade wasn’t just for show, and soon enough, he was dismantling the pirate flank. Lena backed him seamlessly, her shots precise and unnerving in their calm.\n\nMeanwhile, Nila tried her hand at negotiation, attempting to reach some accord with the remaining pirates. Her efforts, though noble, were met with the usual lawlessness expected from space's finest scoundrels. Poor girl, believes too much in the good of all sentient beings.\n\nJax, with that maverick spark in his eyes, couldn't resist the urge to dive headfirst into the fray. His antics, although perilously unorthodox, provided just the distraction we needed. It’s hard to aim at a target zigzagging with a grin.\n\nEzra, with his unshakeable calm, kept us grounded. Amidst chaos, he offered directives that might as well have been verses from some ancient meditation. Sila, bless her spirited heart, was the dynamo—her energy infectious, rallying the crew with cheer that bordered on the insane given the bullets flying.\n\nRonin, silent as the void itself, was a shadow amongst shadows. One minute you see him, the next, an enemy drops without a sound. His quiet efficiency is something I've come to rely on, despite not knowing half of what he's up to.\n\nTara was busy trying to salvage what she could from the wreck we made. Her fascination with tech could probably outlast any of our skirmishes. And Vik, that towering wall of resolve, kept everyone’s backs safe—moving through the battlefield like a storm, unstoppable.\n\nAs for me, Tobin Vex, I was left to tinker under pressure, hacking into pirate comms to sow confusion. Managed to send a few on a wild goose chase to the dark side of Ceres. Got a chuckle out of that.\n\nLog End:\n\nWhat a day. As I patch up our gear and nurse a few new scratches, I can’t help but feel a twisted pride in this dysfunctional family. Against odds, malfunctions, and outright piracy, we stand unbroken. But tomorrow’s another day, and on Ceres, that could mean just about anything.",
    "3": "December 9, 4999\n\nWe've followed an old transmission to a vast canyon in the depths of Uranus III, known as Titania. It turns out there is an outpost that has been overtaken by darkness. All members of the team that once patrolled the facility and succumbed during the cataclysm decades ago have come back to life and now shuffle throughout the place.\n\nDecember 10, 4999\n\nThey are definitely not conscious, but they perform their tasks as if they were still alive. I've seen them pick up cups from the ground and fill their mouths with the dust inside as if it were coffee. It seems that whatever has resurrected them is probing their old brain patterns. It's only a matter of time before they access the system and retrieve the information we are after.\n\nDecember 11, 4999\n\nWe must act now if we want to get ahead of the resurrected. Vex says he can breach the system if we place one of his repeaters in the central computer, a task Ronin has volunteered for. I am certain that Agent Gale is capable of such a task. His reluctance to speak unnerves me, but his silence harbors a staggering loyalty to humanity and our mission. I trust he will succeed.\n\n ERROR 130: ENTRY OVERWRITTEN. LOADING NEW ENTRY...\n\nVex here. I'm sorry for deleting the rest of your boooring entry, Lena, but this is more important.\n\nit was a piece of cake. Now I just need to store this information in a secure location, like the team members' database. It's not the most elegant solution, but it’s protected by an admin password, so no zombie, pirate, or creature of darkness can get to it. I’m a genius.\n\n DATA SUCCESSFULLY TRANSFERRED, 43ms, 238 MB.",
