This version of the game is not complete because by downloading it and playing locally you will miss on sounds and music.
If you want the full experience play it on the link below. By playing on the following link you will have background music and sound
effects but BE WORRY that slow internet connection or other connection issues can lead to slow charge times. Playing on the
link you gain more immersion but you loose on charge times, sprites and image can take some time to charge,
playing locally everything charges instantly but you loose music and sounds:

To open the game locally extract the files on "scape-room-main.zip" and execute index.html

Before playing make sure to check the document that comes with this project and the requirements to play the game properly.

There are some bugs because it's a beta so don't be mad about them,

1- Only properly tested on 1920x1080 devices with 100% scaled, other devices will have visual glitches.
			(Change them on Screen properties)

2- Please USE ONLY GOOGLE CHROME or MICROSOFT EDGE (Other browsers like Opera and Firefox don't have all the requirements to play it, can come with some glitches).

3- In case you dont know your way around this things, right click on "OPEN GAME", open with, Edge or Chrome, or copy the link and paste it on Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.

4- As last tip there is a configuration button where you can skip some things, this options are for debug and accesibility reasons,
using them WILL RUIN the game experience, so if you don't have any physical problems don't use the buttons.

Have fun!!

(PS:You are all kinda testers so any feedback its welcome)
